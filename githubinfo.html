<u1><h2>Q. What is a version control system?</h2>

<li> Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.  </li>
</u1>  
<ul><h2>Q. What is Git? </h2>

<li> By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. </li>
</ul>
    
<ul><h2>Q. What is Github? </h2>
    
<li> GitHub is where over 100 million developers shape the future of software, together. Contribute to the open source community, manage your Git repositories. It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects.  </li>
</ul>

<ul><h2>Q. Who started Github and how was it started? </ul></tr></h2>
    
<li> The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008. Git was largely unknown as a version control system.There were no commercial Git hosting options whatsoever. And so GitHub was created to provide developers the option to host code securely and manage commits to code in proper manner.  </li>
</ul>

<ul><h2>Q. What company owns it now? </ul></tr></h2>
    
<li>  Microsoft Corp </li>
</ul>

<ul><h2>Q. How much does a Github account cost? </ul></tr></h2>
    
<li> GitHub offers free and paid plans for storing and collaborating on code. $49 for active commiter.  </li>
</ul>

<ul><h2>Q. What is the octocat? </ul></tr></h2>
